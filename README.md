# Arduino LCD Screen Library
This updated library enables an Arduino board to communicate with the Arduino
TFT LCD screen. It simplifies the process for drawing shapes, lines, images, and
text to the screen. See also
[the original TFT library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/TFT).

This library requires at least
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) v1.6.8, where v1.8.3 or
newer is recommended.

## How to install
### Manual Installation
Click on the "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner. Exctract the
ZIP file, and *move and rename* the extracted folder either to the location
"**~/Documents/Arduino/libraries**" or to your custom *sketchbook* folder.
Create the "libraries" folder if it doesn't exist. Open Arduino IDE and the new
library should show up in the libraries menu.
